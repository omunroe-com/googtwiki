#summary Scaling Gerrit Installations

= Introduction =

The first step to scaling is to scale your primary master server.  You can scale the server by:

* Adding cores, some of the larger installations use 24 core machines
* Adding RAM, most of the larger installations have at least 48GM, some have 100+GB
* Ensure fast disk IO, SSDs help
* Network, I suspect that most large installs use 10GB
