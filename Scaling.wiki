#summary Scaling Gerrit Installations

= Introduction =

The first step to scaling is to scale your master server.  Some easy, but pricey ways to scale your master are:

  * Adding cores, some of the larger installations use 24 core machines
  * Adding RAM, most of the larger installations have at least 48GM, some have 100+GB
  * Ensure fast disk IO, SSDs help
  * Network, I suspect that most large installs use 10GB
