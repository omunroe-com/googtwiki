#summary Ideas and Decisions about the future of Gerrit

= Introduction =

There are many ideas suggested, and discussions which lead to decisions about the future direction and designs of Gerrit which happen in many forums: on IRC, the ML, at the hackathons, and in the issue tracker.  It can be hard for an outsider to get a feel for where Gerrit might be headed in the near, medium, and long term.  Of course, since this is an open source project, code speaks loudly.  However there are times when the maintainers feel that certain pathes are not the way forward, and the desired alternative may have already been proposed as the way that Gerrit should move.  It can be helpful to developers to get an idea about these decisions before embarking on developping a feature.  Naturally, there are also times when people just want yo get a feel for what might be coming down the pike.  So here we will attempt to illustrate some of these decisions.
