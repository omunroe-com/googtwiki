#summary Executive summary of the list of major Gerrit topics under review and temporarily blocked

=Overview=

Following a   [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/qKz7AtZDlC4 discussion on the mailing list] we decided to create a summary page containing the list of outstanding topics that are currently under review and deserve a particular attention because of their nature.

The purpose of this page is to keep track of them and prevent the risk of them being forgotten in the Gerrit changes backlog. The topics listed here are either related to the Gerrit architecture or to some fixes to severe bugs that need particular attention and time for being reviewed and merged.

==Web Session broken in Gerrit 2.10-SNAPSHOT / master==

Since the merge of [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/48697/ PluggableWebSessionChange] the Gerrit Guice session management is seriously broken. 
The problem is the introduction of `HttpServletResponse` in the [https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/gerrit-httpd/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/httpd/H2CacheBasedWebSession.java H2 implementation] which is not available (and thus set to null) when the Guice context is propagated to background processes.

This needs *URGENT ATTENTION* as the current Gerrit master branch would not be suitable for production use or not good enough for getting a stable-2.10 branch.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+project:gerrit+branch:master+topic:web-session-regression changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22David+Ostrovsky+%253CDavid.Ostrovsky%2540gmx.de%253E%22+status:open DavidO]
  * Status: review started
  * Issues: needs an extra patch on Guice, currently on master but not released yet. It would be helpful if some Google'rs could push this through the internal channels. The problem is as well on the mutability of `HttpServletRequest` cookies when propagating Guice request context.

==Pluggable authentication-backend==

Replace the current Gerrit authentication infrastructure, mainly based on mega-switch/case with the list of protocols/methods supported, with a new plugin-based authentication back-end. 

These changes would allow Gerrit to be more extensible, avoiding further growth of the mega-switch/case all over the code and support the ability to load user plugins to support other authentication systems in the same way that Gerrit groups have been refactored years ago.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+project:gerrit+branch:master+topic:auth-backends-HttpAuthProtocol changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Dariusz+%25C5%2581uksza%22+status:open Dariusz]
  * Status: review started, partially merged
  * Issues: after having merged part of it, the review is now stuck. Needs Shawn attention as the first attempt to merge it broke the Gerrit authentication.

==Scripting plugins==

Introduce the ability to load scripts written in languages different than Java (e.g. Groovy, Scala and potentially any other language that can run on the JVM) and use them as Gerrit plugins for extending Gerrit functionalities.

Currently the plugin-type is an hardcoded Enum that allows only "plugin", "extension" and "javascript" types. Once the changes will be reviewed and merged, Gerrit would potentially support any type of plugin that declares to support a specific file or directory w/ extension.

For an overview on Gerrit Scripting Plugins, see the [http://www.slideshare.net/lucamilanesio/gerrit-code-review-how-to-script-a-plugin-with-scala-and-groovy SlideShare] slide-deck presented at the Gerrit User Summit 2014 @Google.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+topic:scripting-reloaded changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Luca+Milanesio+%253Cluca.milanesio%2540gmail.com%253E%22 Luca]
  * Status: review started, partially merged
  * Issues: after having merged part of it, the review is now stuck. Needs Shawn attention as we are coming to the part of refactoring the current Jar Scanner in order to scan things that are not Jars.

==Secure Store==

Makes the Gerrit secure.config more secure by encrypting its values. This change aims to make the security system applied to the secure.config more generic and pluggable. Potentially the key-value pairs could be stored in an external security vault and not even persisted in the filesystem.

The challenges are actually on where the secure.config is used: all over the place in Gerrit whenever a @GerritServerConfig annotation is present. Additionally when the config gets created the plugin infrastructure and loader are not available: the pluggability then needs to use another discovery system.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+topic:secure-store changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Dariusz+%25C5%2581uksza%22+status:open Dariusz]
  * Status: review started
  * Issues: positive and negative feedbacks on the change. Needs rethinking / reworking possibly to a much simpler approach.
