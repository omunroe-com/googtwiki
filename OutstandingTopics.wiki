#summary Executive summary of the list of major Gerrit topics under review and temporarily blocked

=Overview=

Following a   [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/qKz7AtZDlC4 discussion on the mailing list] we decided to create a summary page containing the list of outstanding topics that are currently under review and deserve a particular attention because of their nature.

The purpose of this page is to keep track of them and prevent the risk of them being forgotten in the Gerrit changes backlog. The topics listed here are either related to the Gerrit architecture or to some fixes to severe bugs that need particular attention and time for being reviewed and merged.

Currently outstanding topics are:
  # [OutstandingTopics#Pluggable_authentication_backend auth-backends-HttpAuthProtocol]
  # [OutstandingTopics#Secure_Store secure-store]
  # [OutstandingTopics#Angular_Gerrit angular-gerrit-integration]

-----

=Pluggable authentication backend=

Replace the current Gerrit authentication infrastructure, mainly based on mega-switch/case with the list of protocols/methods supported, with a new plugin-based authentication back-end. 

These changes would allow Gerrit to be more extensible, avoiding further growth of the mega-switch/case all over the code and support the ability to load user plugins to support other authentication systems in the same way that Gerrit groups have been refactored years ago.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+project:gerrit+branch:master+topic:auth-backends-HttpAuthProtocol changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Dariusz+%25C5%2581uksza%22+status:open Dariusz]
  * Status: review started, partially merged
  * Issues: after having merged part of it, the review is now stuck. Needs Shawn attention as the first attempt to merge it broke the Gerrit authentication.

=Secure Store=

Makes the Gerrit secure.config more secure by encrypting its values. This change aims to make the security system applied to the secure.config more generic and pluggable. Potentially the key-value pairs could be stored in an external security vault and not even persisted in the filesystem.

The challenges are actually on where the secure.config is used: all over the place in Gerrit whenever a @GerritServerConfig annotation is present. Additionally when the config gets created the plugin infrastructure and loader are not available: the pluggability then needs to use another discovery system.

  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Dariusz+%25C5%2581uksza%22+status:open Dariusz]
  * Status: review started
  * Issues: positive and negative feedbacks on the change. Needs rethinking / reworking possibly to a much simpler approach.

=Angular Gerrit=

Dariusz presented at the Gerrit User a prototype for leveraging the REST-API through an AngularJS UX. It has been published to GitHub at https://github.com/dluksza/angular-gerrit.

In order to use the Gerrit-Angular integration a set of changes in the Plugin infrastructure are needed and have been uploaded for review.
