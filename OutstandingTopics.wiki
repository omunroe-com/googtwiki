#summary Executive summary of the list of major Gerrit topics under review and temporarily blocked

=Overview=

Following a   [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/qKz7AtZDlC4 discussion on the mailing list] we decided to create a summary page containing the list of outstanding topics that are currently under review and deserve a particular attention for their nature.

The purpose of this page is to keep track of them and prevent the risk of them being forgotten in the Gerrit changes backlog. The topics listed here are either related to the Gerrit architecture or to some fixes to severe bugs that need particular attention and time for being reviewed and merged.

=Topics=

==Pluggable authentication-backend==

Replace the current Gerrit authentication infrastructure, mainly based on mega-switch/case with the list of protocols/methods supported, with a new plugin-based authentication back-end. 

These changes would allow Gerrit to be more extensible, avoiding further growth of the mega-switch/case all over the code and support the ability to load user plugins to support other authentication systems in the same way that Gerrit groups have been refactored years ago.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+project:gerrit+branch:master+topic:auth-backends-HttpAuthProtocol changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Dariusz+%25C5%2581uksza%22+status:open Dariusz]
  * Status: review started, partially merged
  * Issues: after having merged part of it, the review is now stuck. Needs Shawn attention as the first attempt to merge it broke the Gerrit authentication.

==Scripting plugins==

Introduce the ability to load scripts written in languages different than Java (e.g. Groovy, Scala and potentially any other language that can run on the JVM) and use them as Gerrit plugins for extending Gerrit functionalities.

Currently the plugin-type is an hardcoded Enum that allows only "plugin", "extension" and "javascript" types. Once the changes will be reviewed and merged, Gerrit would potentially support any type of plugin that declares to support a specific file or directory w/ extension.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+topic:scripting-reloaded changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Luca+Milanesio+%253Cluca.milanesio%2540gmail.com%253E%22 Luca]
  * Status: review started, partially merged
  * Issues: after having merged part of it, the review is now stuck. Needs Shawn attention as we are coming to the part of refactoring the current Jar Scanner in order to scan things that are not Jars.

==Secure Store==

Makes the Gerrit secure.config more secure by encrypting its values. This change aims to make the security system applied to the secure.config more generic and pluggable. Potentially the key-value pairs could be stored in an external security vault and not even persisted in the filesystem.

The challenges are actually on where the secure.config is used: all over the place in Gerrit whenever a @GerritServerConfig annotation is present. Additionally when the config gets created the plugin infrastructure and loader are not available: the pluggability then needs to use another discovery system.

  * Gerrit changes: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+topic:secure-store changes]
  * Owner: [https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/owner:%22Dariusz+%25C5%2581uksza%22+status:open Dariusz]
  * Status: review started
  * Issues: positive and negative feedback on the change. Needs rethinking / reworking possibly to a much simpler approach.
